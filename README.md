# `replaceR`
## A Tracery-like Replacement Grammar Implemented in R

`replaceR` generates text by traversing a grammar that is stored as a data table or CSV. This offers a simple and flexible approach to generate text.

[Tracery](https://www.tracery.io) was originally developed by Kate Compton in Javascript for grammars stored in JSON files. For a Tracery implementation in R using JSON see [TraceRy](https://github.com/dill/traceRy) by David Miller.

## Installation

`replaceR` can be installed directly from github.

``` r
devtools::install_github("kurtisturnbull/replaceR") # install
library(replaceR) # load
```

## How this package works

`replaceR` uses grammars stored as data tables. A grammar is a dictionary of
branches (*i.e.* rulesets) that match **symbols** (*i.e.* tags) to
**options** (*i.e.* replacements). When generating text, `replaceR` traverses
these rulesets replacing each symbol randomly with one of its options. We
can recursively reference symbols within options using `#`.
