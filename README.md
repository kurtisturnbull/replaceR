# `replaceR`
# A Tracery-like Replacement Grammar Implemented in R

`replaceR` generates text by traversing a grammar that is stored as a data table or CSV. This offers a simple and flexible approach (for me) to generate text.

[Tracery](https://www.tracery.io) was originally developed by Kate Compton in Javascript for grammars stored in JSON files. For a Tracery implementation in R using JSON see [TraceRy](https://github.com/dill/traceRy) by David Miller.
