Title: A Tracery-like Replacement Grammar Implemented in R
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Kurtis",
           family = "Turnbull",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "kurtisturnbull@gmail.com")
Description: `replaceR` generates text by traversing a grammar that is stored as
a data table or CSV. This offers a simple and flexible approach (for me) to 
generate text.
